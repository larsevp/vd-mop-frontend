# Points 
- This is a interface,- it uses DTOs, current implementation is from the pages/KravTiltak
- Remember the dtos and what should be there, avoid having many options to find things
- I want everything connected to EntityWorkspace to be in this folder, the domain logic is in KravTiltak
- There is contracts for things in the EntityWorkspace,- but remember that these contracts should work with other models as well
